Yeah, this brings back so many memories watching my friends play games at their house and sometimes playing alongside them as well.

That definitely would drive a lot more engagement with the viewers of such streams and would see them coming back.     Just the other day a friend of mine showed me a twitch stream where you can literally play one of the new Pokemon games by entering commands in the chat. I wish I took down the twitch name, because I think the stream is still up and anyone can jump in to play. This could be a fun way to play games.   ",minutes ago killamch said thats insane never knew functions existed certain twitch channels definitely would drive lot engagement viewers streams would see coming back day friend mine showed twitch stream literally play one new pokemon games entering commands chat wish took twitch name think stream still anyone jump play could fun way play games,0.0031801933682513,Baixa,0

12591,12611,12611, Do you sometimes prefer to watch others game instead? ,Kane99,"  Do you guys like to sometimes watch others play video games instead of you? Maybe you want to watch your favorite lets players, or maybe you just want to watch a playthrough for a game you don't ever intend to play. Do you ever do anything like that? Or do you prefer to play the game yourself and experience it by your own hands? I don't mind watching others play, because I can't play every game, and I figure if I can at least watch some lets plays I can see games I never would have played.    I get why some wouldn't like it, but I think it's fine. As long as you enjoy it, why does it matter which way you view it?   ",guys like sometimes watch others play video games instead maybe want watch favorite lets players maybe want watch playthrough game dont ever intend play ever anything like prefer play game experience hands dont mind watching others play cant play every game figure least watch lets plays see games never would played get wouldnt like think fine long enjoy matter way view,0.0032452481409367,Baixa,0
959,963,963, Stupid choices in games ,Shortie,"   3 hours ago, Kane99 said:    I don't like when games give you a 50/50 pick. Pick this or that. Maybe give us more options instead of two that will decide the story for you. I think having more options to choose from, expands the story and gives you more to explore each playthrough too.    I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but I'll say I probably made stupid choices in games in the past, and regretted it because I probably should have done it a different way instead.      I agree. The amount of games I have played in the past that have had the option of two choices and you sit there and think to yourself ""why is there not more options"" and you often think of options that you would have like to see there but aren't. These kind of games that only give you two options often result in sometimes being quick games that you complete and you end up feeling disappointed with the game.   ",hours ago kane said dont like games give pick pick maybe give us options instead two decide story think options choose expands story gives explore playthrough cant think anything top head ill say probably made stupid choices games past regretted probably done different way instead agree amount games played past option two choices sit think options often think options would like see arent kind games give two options often result sometimes quick games complete end feeling disappointed game,0.0032692397328318,Baixa,0

But I do some games that I can work online at the same time while playing them. Like TFT for example, the auto-chess game, which you can play and write articles online or such.

We're all different though. For me, as of late I've been watching a couple movies a night. Sometimes 3. Watching with friends. I've also been binging Community again and I can't watch that show for hours on end.    But I imagine without video games, I would be watching even more. But I may also be leaving my house more.
