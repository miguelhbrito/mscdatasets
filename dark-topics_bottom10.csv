I placed one of his first orders (third I think), about two weeks ago, and he has been nothing but excellent since. We ran into some unforseen issues with the first delivery in the mail, and it seems it got lost (through no fault of Boobear's), and he did everything he could to sort it out and make it right.While we never found the original package, the vendor offered a full reship or full refund without hesitation. Choosing the reship, the vendor packed me up LOADS of extras (with excellent stealth) and shipped it express to my drop the next day. If I could recommend this vendor to everyone who deals with drugs on the deepweb, I would without hesitation. If you need your fix, and want unparalleled, excellent customer service and prices, then order from Boobear23 as fast as you can.There is no doubt I'll be a return customer.",boobear definitely one kind vendor placed one first orders third think two weeks ago nothing excellent since ran unforseen issues first delivery mail seems got lost fault boobears everything could sort make rightwhile never found original package vendor offered full reship full refund without hesitation choosing reship vendor packed loads extras excellent stealth shipped express drop next day could recommend vendor everyone deals drugs deepweb would without hesitation need fix want unparalleled excellent customer service prices order boobear fast canthere doubt ill return customer,0.0028243656973044,Baixa,0

So he was kind of testing the water per se. I'm sure he knows exactly how to work a rtaffle now or maybe he figured out that he doesn't ever want the hassle of doing one ever again lol. So it was probably a mixture of figuring out how to work his first raffle plus more of a delay from real life issues and that resulted in a bungled raffle and lots of angry buyers. He offered you all a winning spot and apologized sincerely several times now! If that doesn't at least fix this certain situation at hadn than nothing will. I mean damn If you all arent going to take the free drugs that this vendor is offering to fix his wrongs than I'm more than willing to take you cut LOL. Seriously though give the vendor a break sometimes things happen in real life to delay online things and also a first time raffle is a kind of learn as you go thing. I'm sure he has it figured out now and like he said in future raffles he will make sure he has the ability to promptly fulfill the raffle or he just won't have one at that time. I mean come one guys Late drugs is better than no drugs at all!  Am I right?Thank you....but yeah I think my days of raffling are over.  I do them alot in real life and in real business and they are successful.  I dont know what this guys issue is but I will just have to settle with not being able to please him.  I'm ok with that.  Thank you again for your understanding I dont know if you are a fellow vendor but you must be on some level to understand.,quote poppypapi november pmyou understand probably first raffle well kind testing water per se im sure knows exactly work rtaffle maybe figured doesnt ever want hassle one ever lol probably mixture figuring work first raffle plus delay real life issues resulted bungled raffle lots angry buyers offered winning spot apologized sincerely several times doesnt least fix certain situation nothing mean damn arent going take free drugs vendor offering fix wrongs im willing take cut lol seriously though give vendor break sometimes things happen real life delay online things also first time raffle kind learn go thing im sure figured like said future raffles make sure ability promptly fulfill raffle wont one time mean come one guys late drugs better drugs rightthank youbut yeah think days raffling alot real life real business successful dont know guys issue settle able please im ok thank understanding dont know fellow vendor must level understand,0.002836004366438,Baixa,0

Not only did I receive a prompt response from Boosie but I was offered an immediate reship.  Having been a customer for a long time this felt great, Boosie didn't even have to bat an eye at this review but he made it right.  That speaks loudly to his character.  The order came fast as possible given the holiday (2 bus. days) and was perfectly packaged and sealed.  This time it was a blondish/amber shatter (pull/snap) that smells like heaven and tastes like it too.  It weighed .7g over (holy shit right?) and I could not be happier.  One honest miscue on Boosie's part over all this time doing business and he went above and beyond to fix it.  If anything ever goes wrong in the future I think I owe him one ; )  I honestly have to say that I can't think of a single point that would be deducted given the final outcome.  Boosie is 100/100 in my book.",update receive prompt response boosie offered immediate reship customer long time felt great boosie didnt even bat eye review made right speaks loudly character order came fast possible given holiday bus days perfectly packaged sealed time blondishamber shatter pullsnap smells like heaven tastes like weighed g holy shit right could happier one honest miscue boosies part time business went beyond fix anything ever goes wrong future think owe one honestly say cant think single point would deducted given final outcome boosie book,0.003005673918785,Baixa,0

Just needed to clear my head a bit on this and see what others would have to say. This is a subject I just cant bring up among my friends and co-workers. They are not even aware that this exists. I know of only two other people that have ever heard of the deep web and I just acted like I was stupid and never heard of it before. It was at work and the last thing I need is to be overheard in a conversation about how you can order drugs and shit online. I just played along in utter amazement that such a thing even exists. I wonder how many other people do the same thing? Makes me wonder sometimes. I appreciate all your responses.,think knew answer posted needed clear head bit see others would say subject cant bring among friends coworkers even aware exists know two people ever heard deep web acted like stupid never heard work last thing need overheard conversation order drugs shit online played along utter amazement thing even exists wonder many people thing makes wonder sometimes appreciate responses,0.0030102309225445,Baixa,0
