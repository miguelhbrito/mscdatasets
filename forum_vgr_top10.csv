18437,18472,18472, Why is it that games usually come out on Tuesdays? ,Reality vs Adventure,  I didn't know that. Maybe they have a backdoor agreement with retail to help draw in customers during the week when business is less. Movies don't go through retail so that's why it's always released on weekends when people have more time and get that big opening night for ratings. That's my two cents from this pocket full of pennies.   ,didnt know maybe backdoor agreement retail help draw customers week business less movies dont go retail thats always released weekends people time get big opening night ratings thats two cents pocket full pennies,0.8997048813462828,Alta,1

Hacked clients don't work on some multiplayer servers though, but may work on others.
