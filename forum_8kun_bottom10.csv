152,152,19,Genshin Impact,16954755,bac8d5,16954754,The character and weapon levels are locked behind account levels because thats how the progression works. You get to a certain account level and it raises your world tier and makes all the enemies in the world tougher and drop better loot. If you're finding all the enemies too easy you're probably just close to having your world tier go up thats all.I do agree about the typical gacha power creep where new characters they introduce will probably end up outclassing the old ones to keep the whales wallets empty but this is a PVE game so theres hardly a good reason to feel constrained to a meta.,,character weapon levels locked behind account levels thats progression works get certain account level raises world tier makes enemies world tougher drop better loot youre finding enemies easy youre probably close world tier go thats alli agree typical gacha power creep new characters introduce probably end outclassing old ones keep whales wallets empty pve game theres hardly good reason feel constrained meta,0.00527099952459,Baixa,0

409,409,58, Black Lives Splatter Game,16944476,e78559,16944471,I wouldn't violate the TOS though if I were this dev. Makes more sense to do it as a legit statement about their movement and if it does get censored decry it as a violation of freedom of speech. If you do it properly it makes the games journalists look like they're opposing free speech in favour of a cause that is violent. It'd give us exactly what we wanted which is a smoking gun calling these fucking hackjobs out for advocating the violence that BLM has brought onto the world. It shows the biases in the system. If you just troll steam no one will care. This is why Hatred worked. Follow Hatred's model. It has to be a legitimate thing otherwise it won't showcase how full of shit these people really are.,,wouldnt violate tos though dev makes sense legit statement movement get censored decry violation freedom speech properly makes games journalists look like theyre opposing free speech favour cause violent itd give us exactly wanted smoking gun calling fucking hackjobs advocating violence blm brought onto world shows biases system troll steam one care hatred worked follow hatreds model legitimate thing otherwise wont showcase full shit people really,0.0056322460627617,Baixa,0
