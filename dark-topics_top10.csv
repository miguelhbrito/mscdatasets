Uncle Sam ONLY uses windows. As in, on air force networks Linux(even ones running the navy exclusively developed distro) and Mac machines are not allowed. 

For the only OS the government is allowed to use(make no questions, it's because they don't want to be assed with managing their own security) there is no way there isn't a backdoor for every government agency to exploit.

However, you'd probably have to piss off DoD for that to be a problem, I doubt they'd give that kind of thing to local LE.",indeterminable probability windows backdoor uncle sam uses windows air force networks linuxeven ones running navy exclusively developed distro mac machines allowed os government allowed usemake questions dont want assed managing security way isnt backdoor every government agency exploit however youd probably piss dod problem doubt theyd give kind thing local le,0.9629295989115028,Alta,1
