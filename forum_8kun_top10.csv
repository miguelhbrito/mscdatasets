747,747,49,/agdg/ thread!,16941861,5583af,,"Hey /agdg/ there's something I want to bounce by you guys, because I've been on the fence about it.I'm an anon who has undertaken the task of making a rewrite of feralpheonix's Uncommon Time, last year. As far as script, I've made a whole ton of progress on that front- about 70% done to be precise.Lately however, I've been meditating on just what kind of game I'd want to make. I've realized that the Uncommon time Project I've been making is exactly what I want to make. The problem is, I've been getting into Godot, and part of me wants to use parts of the story and go on my own path with it.I really don't know what to do, /agdg/. RPGmakerVXAce is nice, but it has the problem I have with most of the entry-level game engines: accessible with some things, but completely asinine if you want to do anything more advanced. The thing is, I'm still learning how to use Godot. I have plenty of programming experience, except that It's frustrating trying to relearn how to program in GDscript. The last time I did game programming was flixel with Actionscript 3, that was years ago.It wouldn't be too hard for more to reimagine the characters, the setting and the world for what I've made for my Uncommon Time project, the problem is, I would have to redo all the busywork-related assets by scratch. If I do this, I would be able to actually sell the game for money, and not be bound by the requirements of Uncommon Time as an IP.The flip-side, with just using RPGmaker and hacking my way through with it. I could actually get this project done. I wouldn't make any money with it, and FP could have a reason to get pissed at me, but it would be an actually-done game. At times, THAT is the most important.I don't know what to do /agdg/ what should I do?",,hey agdg theres something want bounce guys ive fence itim anon undertaken task making rewrite feralpheonixs uncommon time last year far script ive made whole ton progress front done preciselately however ive meditating kind game id want make ive realized uncommon time project ive making exactly want make problem ive getting godot part wants use parts story go path iti really dont know agdg rpgmakervxace nice problem entrylevel game engines accessible things completely asinine want anything advanced thing im still learning use godot plenty programming experience except frustrating trying relearn program gdscript last time game programming flixel actionscript years agoit wouldnt hard reimagine characters setting world ive made uncommon time project problem would redo busyworkrelated assets scratch would able actually sell game money bound requirements uncommon time ipthe flipside using rpgmaker hacking way could actually get project done wouldnt make money fp could reason get pissed would actuallydone game times importanti dont know agdg,0.4888081345899469,Média,0

All 21 slides are in Japanese but I have machine translated them to english.<Slide 1 (title slide)Political Correctness and Points to Consider in Creating Advertising Materials <Slide 2Political Correctness, as the Capcom brand is becoming more and more well-known overseas. Using politically and socially fair and neutral words and phrases is growing rapidly in importance.We are required to be conscious of using fair and equitable language and terms that do not include social discrimination or prejudice due to appearance, occupation, gender, culture, race, ethnicity, faith, ideology, health/disability, age, marital status or LGBT.The most recent example is the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement (a global demonstration against police brutality against African Americans).In addition, the number of areas and PR/advertising materials (trailers and art) that need to be created with caution in each region and in the production of PR/advertising materials (trailers and art) is increasing, so the guidelines will be mielized again.In particular, the number of players with diverse backgrounds, tastes and sensitivities is increasing as our titles have grown in sales globally.More attention is needed.Food x religious taboos (be careful of Arabic localization)Foods that Muslims (i.e., Muslims) avoid that require special attention: ""pork,"" ""alcohol,"" ""blood,"" and ""meat that has not been properly processed religiously.Reminder that paid shills were pushing the marketing ploy of ""Crapcom's redemption arc"" in order to make people go back to giving money to the company, pretending that they would do better.Now you can see the results of supporting a shitty company such as Crapcom.All companies are evil.Note: Crapcom wants to pander to mudlsimes AND LGBT abominations at the same time.
